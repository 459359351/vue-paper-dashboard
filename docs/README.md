## Short description and usage

[Vue Paper Dashboard](https://github.com/cristijora/vue-paper-dashboard) is a beautiful resource built over Bootstrap and Vue. It will help you get started developing dashboards in no time. Vue Paper Dashboard is a Vue ported version of the [Original Paper Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-dashboard).
Using the Dashboard is pretty simple but requires basic knowledge of Javascript, [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/).

Vue Paper Dashboard was coded by [Cristi Jora](https://github.com/cristijora) and the design was made by [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/?ref=pdf-vuejs-doc).

## Getting started

Vue Paper Dashboard is built on top of Bootstrap 4, Vue and Vue-router and Vue CLI 3.
To get started do the following steps:

1. Clone or download the [Project](https://github.com/cristijora/vue-paper-dashboard)
2. Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
3. Type `npm install` in the source folder where `package.json` is located
4. Type `npm run dev` to start the development server

The repo uses [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) scaffolding which takes care
of the development setup with webpack and all the necessary modern tools to make web development faster and easier.

#### Npm tasks:
- `npm run dev` - starts a development server on `localhost:8080` with live-reload
- `npm run build` - builds the app for production with javascript minification and versioning
